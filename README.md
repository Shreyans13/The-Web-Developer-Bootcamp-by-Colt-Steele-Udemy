# The Web Developer Bootcamp
The only course you need to learn web development - HTML, CSS, JS, Node, and More!

When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the "beginner friendly" classes.  With this course, you get the best of both worlds.  This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.

Throughout the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:

    HTML5
    CSS3
    JavaScript
    Bootstrap 4
    SemanticUI
    DOM Manipulation
    jQuery
    Unix(Command Line) Commands
    NodeJS
    NPM
    ExpressJS
    REST
    MongoDB
    Database Associations
    Authentication
    PassportJS
    Authorization

This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of "watch as I code" videos.  This course is different. I've incorporated everything I learned in my years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:

    Lectures
    Code-Alongs
    Projects
    Exercises
    Research Assignments
    Slides
    Downloads
    Readings
    Too many pictures of my dog Rusty

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.  I got into this industry because I love working with people and helping students learn.  Sign up today and see how fun, exciting, and rewarding web development can be!
